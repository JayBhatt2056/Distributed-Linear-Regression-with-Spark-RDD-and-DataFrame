Developed a distributed linear regression model using Apache Spark to implement a closed-form solution for 
Î¸ = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y. 
The project utilized RDDs and DataFrames to compute the matrix operations across large datasets, including the Boston Housing Dataset. Implemented the solution with Spark SQL queries and Breeze library for matrix operations. Performance comparisons between RDD- and DataFrame-based implementations provided insights into computational efficiency across varying dataset sizes.
